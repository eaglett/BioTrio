<h1>BioTrio</h1>

BioTrio was a 2nd semester final project. It's created fully in Java Spring.

We created a cinema system that allows users to create an account(and do all CRUD functions), view movies that are currently in the cinema and buy tickets.

There is also a part of the system that is accessible only to the cinema employees. We used Spring Security to ensure that only authorized personnel had access to certain functionalities. Manager can manage(CRUD) employees.

All of the employees can reserve tickets for customers, for example if a customer wants to reserve a ticket via a phone call. Tickets were delivered via email and sms.
